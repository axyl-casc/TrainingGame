# Repository Guide

This project is a lightweight browser-based training tracker. The JavaScript files follow standard ES module syntax and use 2 spaces for indentation. There are no automated tests yet, so manual checks are sufficient.

When editing the code, please keep the style consistent and make sure any new objectives remain short and easy to read. If you add dependencies or new files, update `readme.md` accordingly.

To run the app simply open `index.html` in a browser. No build steps or server environment are required.
